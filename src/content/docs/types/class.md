:::note
Go does not have classes like JavaScript/TypeScript.
:::

In Go you use the [`struct`](/types/object) type to create data structures that are similar to classes in JavaScript/TypeScript. Structs can have fields and methods associated with them, but they do not support inheritance or the `this` keyword.
