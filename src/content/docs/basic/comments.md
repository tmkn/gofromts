description: How to define comments in Go.
---

To start of easy, comments in Go work the same way as in TypeScript and JavaScript.

There is `//` for single line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.

```go title="comments.go"
// This is a single line comment
/* This is a multi-line comment
   that spans multiple lines */

```
