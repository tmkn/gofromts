This guide is specifically designed for JavaScript/TypeScript developers who are looking to learn Go.

As such it's not intended to teach you Go from scratch, there are already many great resources for that. Instead it tries to teach you Go by leveraging your existing knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript by comparing the two languages.

While you don't need to be an expert in JavaScript/TypeScript, you should have a basic understanding of the language and its concepts.
