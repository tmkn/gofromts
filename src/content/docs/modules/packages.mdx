description: What are packages in Go and how to use them.
---

In Go, packages are the fundamental tool for organizing your source code, and compared to JavaScript, you'll notice a far more structured approach defined by a handful of conventions.

This design philosophy is key to creating a clean and maintainable codebase. It's built upon the following core principles:

- **Package declaration**: Every Go file must start with a package declaration.
- **No `export` keyword**: Visibility is determined by the case of the first letter of the identifier.
- **Splitting code**: A package can consist of multiple files.
- **Package naming**: The package name is usually the same as the directory it is in.
- **No relative imports**: Go does not allow relative imports, only absolute imports.
- **No cyclic imports**: Go does not allow cyclic imports.

## Package Declaration

Every Go file must start with a package declaration. It tells Go which **package** the file belongs to.

```go title="calculator/operations.go" "package calculator"
package calculator

// ...
```

It's a convention in Go to name the package the same as the directory it in (but more on that later). The `operations.go` file is in the `calculator` directory, so its package name is `calculator`.

## No `export` keyword

Unlike JavaScript/TypeScript, Go does not use keywords like `export` to manage visibility. Instead, it is based on the case of the first letter:

- **Starting with Uppercase**: Identifier (variable, function, type, etc.) is exported and accessible by other packages.
- **Starting with Lowercase**: Identifier is private (accessible only by their own package)
